NAME
    LWP::Protocol::https - Provide https support for LWP::UserAgent

SYNOPSIS
      use LWP::UserAgent;

      $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new(ssl_opts => { verify_hostname => 1 });
      $res = $ua->get("https://www.example.com");

DESCRIPTION
    The LWP::Protocol::https module provide support for using https schemed
    URLs with LWP. This module is a plug-in to the LWP protocol handling, so
    you don't use it directly. Once the module is installed LWP is able to
    access sites using HTTP over SSL/TLS.

    This module used to be bundled with the libwww-perl, but it was
    unbundled in v6.02 in order to be able to declare its dependencies
    properly for the CPAN tool-chain. Applications that need https support
    can just declare their dependency on LWP::Protocol::https and will no
    longer need to know what underlying modules to install.
