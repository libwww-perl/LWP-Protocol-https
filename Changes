6.02      2011-03-27
    - Initial release of LWP-Protocol-https as a separate distribution. There
      are no code changes besides setting the version number since
      libwww-perl-6.01.
    - The LWP::Protocol::https module used to be bundled with the libwww-perl
      distribution, but it was unbundled in v6.02 in order to be able to declare
      its dependencies properly for the CPAN tool chain.  Applications that need
      https support can just declare their dependency on LWP::Protocol::https
      and will no longer need to know what underlying modules to install.
